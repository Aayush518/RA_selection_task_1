    "\n",
    "- `logging`: For structured logging of progress, errors, and key events, which is crucial for debugging and reproducibility in research code.\n",
    "- `os`: To handle file and directory operations, such as creating output folders and checking file existence.\n",
    "- `time`: For measuring execution time of various steps, which is important for performance profiling.\n",
    "- `numpy`: The fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, used here for array operations on image data.\n",
    "- `nibabel`: Specialized for reading and writing medical imaging data in NIfTI format, which is standard in neuroimaging and many other medical imaging fields.\n",
    "- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For visualizing images, histograms, and segmentation results, which is essential for both qualitative and quantitative analysis.\n",
    "- `scipy.ndimage`: Provides advanced image processing functions, such as morphological operations and labeling connected components, which are key for segmentation and mask refinement.\n",
    "- `skimage.filters`: Used for image filtering and thresholding, including Otsu's method for automatic threshold selection.\n",
