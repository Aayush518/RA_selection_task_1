    "\n",
    "- `logging`: For structured logging of progress, errors, and key events, which is crucial for debugging and reproducibility in research code.\n",
    "- `os`: To handle file and directory operations, such as creating output folders and checking file existence.\n",
    "- `time`: For measuring execution time of various steps, which is important for performance profiling.\n",
    "- `numpy`: The fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, used here for array operations on image data.\n",
    "- `nibabel`: Specialized for reading and writing medical imaging data in NIfTI format, which is standard in neuroimaging and many other medical imaging fields.\n",
    "- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For visualizing images, histograms, and segmentation results, which is essential for both qualitative and quantitative analysis.\n",
    "- `scipy.ndimage`: Provides advanced image processing functions, such as morphological operations and labeling connected components, which are key for segmentation and mask refinement.\n",
    "- `skimage.filters`: Used for image filtering and thresholding, including Otsu's method for automatic threshold selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By importing these libraries at the start, we ensure that all subsequent code cells have access to the necessary tools for data loading, processing, analysis, and visualization."
